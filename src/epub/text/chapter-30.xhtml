			<h2>30 The Louse and the Flea</h2>
			<p>A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell. Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself. On this the little flea began to scream loudly. Then said the little room-door, “Little flea, why art thou screaming?” “Because the louse has burnt herself.”</p>
			<p>Then the little door began to creak. On this a little broom in the corner said, “Why art thou creaking, little door?” “Have I not reason to creak?”</p>
			<p class="poem">“The little louse has burnt herself,<br/>
			The little flea is weeping.”</p>
			<p>So the little broom began to sweep frantically. Then a little cart passed by and said, “Why art thou sweeping, little broom?” “Have I not reason to sweep?”</p>
			<p class="poem">“The little louse has burnt herself,<br/>
			The little flea is weeping,<br/>
			The little door is creaking.”</p>
			<p>So the little cart said, “Then I will run,” and began to run wildly. Then said the ash-heap by which it ran, “Why art thou running so, little cart?” “Have I not reason to run?”</p>
			<p class="poem">“The little louse has burnt herself,<br/>
			The little flea is weeping,<br/>
			The little door is creaking,<br/>
			The little broom is sweeping.”</p>
			<p>The ash-heap said, “Then I will burn furiously,” and began to burn in clear flames. A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said, “Ash-heap, why art thou burning?” “Have I not reason to burn?”</p>
			<p class="poem">“The little louse has burnt herself,<br/>
			The little flea is weeping,<br/>
			The little door is creaking,<br/>
			The little broom is sweeping,<br/>
			The little cart is running.”</p>
			<p>The little tree said, “Then I will shake myself,” and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, “Little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?” “Have I not reason to shake myself?”</p>
			<p class="poem">“The little louse has burnt herself,<br/>
			The little flea is weeping,<br/>
			The little door is creaking,<br/>
			The little broom is sweeping,<br/>
			The little cart is running,<br/>
			The little ash-heap is burning.”</p>
			<p>On this the girl said, “Then I will break my little water-pitcher,” and she broke her little water-pitcher. Then said the little spring from which ran the water, “Girl, why art thou breaking thy water-jug?” “Have I not reason to break my water-jug?”</p>

			The little ash-heap is burning,<br/>
			The little tree is shaking itself.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, ho!” said the spring, “then I will begin to flow,” and began to flow violently. And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together.</p>
